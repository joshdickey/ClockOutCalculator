# ClockOutCalculator
Python program used to calculate when you can clock out of work for the day ( for an 8 hr work day ).
The company I am at uses Kronos for its timecard. 
*****************************************************

I wrote this simple program to make it easier to know exactly when I needed to clock out without having to do any time math. 
Currently there is no error handling for incorrect input ( I plan of correcitng this). And the output formatting needs to be worked on as well. 

*****************************************************
Definitions:

The Current total hours:minutes worked is the cumulative hours worked for a 2 week pay period as shown in Kronos. 

The last punched in time is the latest, logged time that you clocked in.
